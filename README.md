# AI Project: LPG Demand Prediction

## Overview
This small project predicts LPG demand using **linear regression** with Python libraries.  
It’s designed to be easy to run and easy to understand — great for coursework, demos, or a quick portfolio piece.

## Why this project
- Shows the full workflow: data handling, model training, prediction, and visualization.  
- Uses common, industry tools (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`).  
- Can be run in **IDLE**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or **VS Code** so you can use whichever environment you prefer.

---

## Features
- **Data handling** with **pandas**.  
- **Linear regression** using **scikit-learn**.  
- **Visualization** with **matplotlib** (actual vs predicted).  
- Predicts LPG demand for future population values.

---

## Requirements
- **Python 3.11 (64-bit)** recommended.  
- Required libraries must be installed:
  - **pandas**
  - **scikit-learn**
  - **matplotlib**
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code(Visual Studio Code)

# Installation Steps
Download the Code Save the provided Python code as 'LPG Predictor Regression Model.py' Run the Application : python 'LPG Predictor Regression Model.py' No Additional Dependencies Required Uses only Python standard libraries No external packages to install, also if you don't want to deal with IDLE use VS Code OR Jupyter Notebook


# Instructions for Testing
- Unit test style manual checks
  -  Run the script and confirm it prints predicted values for the sample future populations (1120 and 1140).
  - Confirm a plot window opens showing blue points for actual data and red points for predicted values.

 
Interactive Check (VS Code)
Follow these steps to test interactively in VS Code:
- Open the project folder in VS Code.
- Install the Python extension if not already installed.
- Select the correct Python interpreter from the status bar (choose the virtual environment you created).
- Open LPG Predictor Regression Model.py in the editor.
- Run the script using the Run button in the top-right of the editor or press F5. Alternatively run from the integrated terminal:

 

# Expected Outcomes
Predicted LPG Demand (Tonnes):  
Month 1: 80.00  
Month 2: 85.00  


Visualization: a scatter plot titled LPG Demand: Actual vs Predicted with:
- Blue markers for actual sample data points (populations 1000–1100).
- Red markers for predicted points (population 1120 → 80 tonnes, population 1140 → 85 tonnes).
- Interpretation: the model should show a steady increase in predicted LPG demand as population increases. Because the dataset is small and synthetic, expect the model to be illustrative rather than production‑grade.
